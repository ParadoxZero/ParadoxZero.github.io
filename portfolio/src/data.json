                "I was in fifth grade when I first “hacked” Age of empires. That’s when I started seeing computers as more than a game console. In eight grade, from an example VB.NET program in my textbook (a program to add 2 numbers), I learned the basics of programming. I was too young and didn’t have internet for tutorial, but still with the Visual studio help, Created lot’s of prank apps. That’s around when I fell in love with programing. In 11th grade I took up Computer Science, and finished the coursework about C++ (including stuffs from 12th grade ) in 2–3 months, that’s how much I loved it.",
                "For me programing is not just about developing a software, it’s about solving a problem or a challenge. It’s a hobby. First remarkable thing I wrote up was a gravity simulator using BGI graphics of TurboC++. You could throw balls here and there, it will always falls according to the projectile motion. That was around in middle of 11th grade. I loved it.",
